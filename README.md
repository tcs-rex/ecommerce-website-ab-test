# E-Commerce Website A/B Testing Project

## Introduction
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. The goals of this project include understanding the results of an A/B test run for an e-commerce website, and completing jupyter notebook work to help the company understand if they should:

1. Implement the new webpage,
2. Keep the old webpage, or
3. Perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
